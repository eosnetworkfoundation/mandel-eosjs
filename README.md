# eosjs ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dw/eosjs.svg)

Javascript API for integration with EOSIO-based blockchains using [EOSIO RPC API](/developer-tools/01_nodeos/index.md).

## Installation

### NPM

The officially distributed npm packed will be posted soon.

### NodeJS Dependency

`yarn add eosjs`

### Using with Typescript

In order to get access to the `TextEncoding` and `TextDecoding` types, you need to add `@types/text-encoding` as a dev dependency:
`yarn add --dev @types/text-encoding`

If you're using Node (not a browser) then you'll also need to make sure the `dom` lib is referenced in your `tsconfig.json`:

```
{
	"compilerOptions": {
		"lib": [..., "dom"]
	}
}
```

### Browser Distribution

Clone this repository locally then run `yarn build-web`.  The browser distribution will be located in `dist-web` and can be directly copied into your project repository. The `dist-web` folder contains minified bundles ready for production, along with source mapped versions of the library for debugging.

## Import

### ES Modules

Importing using ES6 module syntax in the browser is supported if you have a transpiler, such as Babel.
```js
import { Api, JsonRpc, RpcError } from 'eosjs';
import { JsSignatureProvider } from 'eosjs/dist/eosjs-jssig';           // development only
```

### CommonJS

Importing using commonJS syntax is supported by NodeJS out of the box.
```js
const { Api, JsonRpc, RpcError } = require('eosjs');
const { JsSignatureProvider } = require('eosjs/dist/eosjs-jssig');      // development only
const fetch = require('node-fetch');                                    // node only; not needed in browsers
const { TextEncoder, TextDecoder } = require('util');                   // node only; native TextEncoder/Decoder
const { TextEncoder, TextDecoder } = require('text-encoding');          // React Native, IE11, and Edge Browsers only
```

## Basic Usage

### Signature Provider

The Signature Provider holds private keys and is responsible for signing transactions.

***Using the JsSignatureProvider in the browser is not secure and should only be used for development purposes. Use a secure vault outside of the context of the webpage to ensure security when signing transactions in production***

```js
const defaultPrivateKey = "5JtUScZK2XEp3g9gh7F8bwtPTRAkASmNrrftmx4AxDKD5K4zDnr"; // bob
const signatureProvider = new JsSignatureProvider([defaultPrivateKey]);
```

### JSON-RPC

Open a connection to JSON-RPC, include `fetch` when on NodeJS.
```js
const rpc = new JsonRpc('http://127.0.0.1:8888', { fetch });
```

### API

Include textDecoder and textEncoder when using in Node, React Native, IE11 or Edge Browsers.
```js
const api = new Api({ rpc, signatureProvider, textDecoder: new TextDecoder(), textEncoder: new TextEncoder() });
```

### Sending a transaction

`transact()` is used to sign and push transactions onto the blockchain with an optional configuration object parameter.  This parameter can override the default value of `broadcast: true`, and can be used to fill TAPOS fields given `blocksBehind` and `expireSeconds`.  Given no configuration options, transactions are expected to be unpacked with TAPOS fields (`expiration`, `ref_block_num`, `ref_block_prefix`) and will automatically be broadcast onto the chain.

With the introduction of Mandel v3.1 the retry transaction feature also adds 5 new optional fields to the configuration object:

- `useOldRPC`: use old RPC `push_transaction`, rather than new RPC send_transaction
- `useOldSendRPC`: use old RPC `/v1/chain/send_transaction`, rather than new RPC `/v1/chain/send_transaction2`
- `returnFailureTrace`: return partial traces on failed transactions
- `retryTrxNumBlocks`: request node to retry transaction until in a block of given height, blocking call
- `retryIrreversible`: request node to retry transaction until it is irreversible or expires, blocking call

```js
(async () => {
  const result = await api.transact({
    actions: [{
      account: 'eosio.token',
      name: 'transfer',
      authorization: [{
        actor: 'useraaaaaaaa',
        permission: 'active',
      }],
      data: {
        from: 'useraaaaaaaa',
        to: 'useraaaaaaab',
        quantity: '0.0001 SYS',
        memo: '',
      },
    }]
  }, {
    blocksBehind: 3,
    expireSeconds: 30
  });
  console.dir(result);
})();
```

### Error handling

use `RpcError` for handling RPC Errors
```js
...
try {
  const result = await api.transact({
  ...
} catch (e) {
  console.log('\nCaught exception: ' + e);
  if (e instanceof RpcError)
    console.log(JSON.stringify(e.json, null, 2));
}
...
```
