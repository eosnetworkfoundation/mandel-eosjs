# Testing and Building with DUNE

DUNE makes it easier to test locally. Performing integration tests with DUNE requires some setup.
[DUNE may be installed from git hub](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/DUNE)

## Open Local Node Port

Need to change **scripts/config.ini** from `http-server-address = 127.0.0.1:8888` to `http-server-address = 0.0.0.0:8888`. This will enable port 8888 to listen on all ports, and that is needed because docker runs on a different network.

This is part of the docker image, so this must be completed before running `bootstrap`. If you already have a docker image you can
* Destroy the docker container
* Remove docker image
* Re-run bootstrap

An alternative option is to enter the docker container, change the configuration, and restart the node.

## DUNE Keys

Once you follow the directions you need to grap the keys for the existing eosio account.

```
egrep 'priv_key|pub_key' src/dune/*.py
```

## Private Keys in Tests

Look at `src/tests/node.js` and `src/tests/web.html` to make sure the private key matches DUNE's.

## Start a Node

Start a node if you haven't already
```
dune --start test_node
```

## Create Wallet

Bit of a workaround here as of Aug 2022 there is a permissions problem. Workaround
1 create an account that will fail
2 new account created wallet
3 change permissions on wallet

### Create An Account Will Fail
```
dune --create-account thiswillfail
Creating account [nodeone] with key pair [Private: 5K4GCQPREhc6HmJ2wWNqRHvVNSL1bZ79hu8grtmkUhGJcndUfMg, Public: EOS8DMcuK28sN7jw8Uj5gEKtH8JxdbhovhVkDaUoQAemo49RBse97]
Error 3120006: No available wallet
Ensure that you have created a wallet and have it open
Error Details:
You don't have any wallet!
Stack Trace:
wallet_manager.cpp:140 get_public_keys
```

### Change Permissions on Docker Container

```
docker exec -u root -it dune_container cp /root/eosio-wallet/default.wallet /home/www-data/eosio-wallet/
docker exec -u root -it dune_container chown www-data:www-data /home/www-data/eosio-wallet/default.wallet
```

## Create Accounts

Now we can create our test accounts. In the examples below replace, **priv_key** and **pub_key** with the values from [DUNE Keys](#DUNE Keys)

```
dune --create-account bob eosio pub_key priv_key
dune --create-account alice eosio pub_key priv_key
```

## Run Tests

```
yarn test node
```
